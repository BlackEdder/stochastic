# Stochastic library for the D programming Language

## Goal

This library implements various functions needed useful for stochastic simulations. The project is still very young. It supports random drawing from normal and exponential distribution. Implementation of the gillespie algorithm is planned for the near future.

## License

The library is distributed under the GPL-v3 license. See the file COPYING for more details.
